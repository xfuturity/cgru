============
Changes Log
============

If Afanasy **network protocol changed**, it became incompatible with old one.

- The first number in the version means some significant changes in the project.
  Probably you should reconfigure Afanasy.
- The second number means major changes that caused compatibility lost.
  You should upgrade all clients and server at once.
- The third number versions are fully compatible.
  You can upgrade only one client or server for changes.


.. _changes-log-latest:

v3.3.1
======

2023.03.12

- Afanasy service can be configured to limit task post command running time.
  Task post commands are used to generate thumbnails.
  By default ``af_task_post_limit_sec`` config variable stands for it, and it is 16 seconds.
  Later (on limit exceeded) task post command will be killed.

- Afanasy can be configured not to cut domain names from user and host names.
  New parameters ``af_render_cut_domain_name`` and ``af_user_cut_domain_name`` added to control this.
  The default behaviour is the same as before, domain names will be cut.

- Afanasy statistics database tables got new rows.
  Job blocks got job serial. Tasks run got job serial, block and task ids.
  See `database schema <../afanasy/server.html#database-schema>`_.

- Nuke Afanasy Gizmo can set extra
  `environment <../software/nuke.html#environment>`_
  variables that will be added to task process.
  You use it to store Nuke location and version.

- Houdini Afanasy ROP can set extra
  `environment <../software/houdini.html#environment>`_
  variables that will be added to task process.
  You use it to store Houdini location and version.

- AfWatch can edit job block environment variables.

- AfWatch now uses ``open_folder_cmd`` config variable to open folders.

- Afanasy server will not allow to change a pool of a busy render.

- Afanasy server branches action added ``delete_done_jobs``. You can delete all done jobs from branch from AfWatch.

- Afanasy jobs branch can be paused.

- Afanasy user can be paused.

- Server annoying error log removed on a running job deletion.

- Rules Python API started.


v3.3.0
======

2022.07.25

- AfRender can send to server `GPU resources <../afanasy/render.html#gpu-string>`_:
  utilization, temperature, memory total and used.

  .. note::

    This feature is sponsored by SMF Animation Studio, LLC

  For now, just NVIDIA is supported.

- New job block need parameters:
  `GPU Memory <../afanasy/job_block.html#need-gpu-mem-mb>`_,
  `CPU Frequency <../afanasy/job_block.html#need-cpu-freq-mgz>`_,
  `CPU Cores <../afanasy/job_block.html#need-cpu-cores>`_ and
  `CPU Cores*Frequency <../afanasy/job_block.html#need-cpu-freq-cores>`_.

- AfWatch and WebGUI shows some summary info, when several jobs are selected.

- AfWatch got and "Administration" menu to switch to super user mode with password.

- AfWatch warning and error messages and super user mode label highlighted to attract more attention.
  When selection is not allowed, nodes list displays a warning message.

- Now parser checks whether the task progress was changed.
  Later server had to compare previous and new percentage value.
  And this behaviour was build-in.
  Now you can override it by parser.
  A new `progress_changed <../afanasy/render.html#self-progress-changed-false-true>`_ variable for it was added.
  And by default, progress is changed if task produced any output.

- New task state flag `Wait Dependencies <../afanasy/job_task.html#state>`_ appeared.
  Now tasks that wait some other tasks will be marked with this flag.
  Tasks with this flag are skipped during job solving.
  So now task dependencies will not wait the last frame of unbroken sequence.

- **Bugfixes:**

    - AfServer and job block with no task crash fixed.
      The crash was very rare, another block with tasks should follow a block without tasks.


v3.2.2
======

2022.02.09

- AfServer ``JOB_CREATED`` event added.

- Afanasy config: Parameter of a string array type can be overridden by command arguments or environment by a string contains a comma separated items.

v3.2.1
======

2021.08.19

- Houdini Afanasy `TOP Scheduler <../software/houdini.html#afanasy-top-scheduler>`_.

- Houdini setup changed. Now ``HOUDINI_PATH=cgru/plugins/houdini`` and *afanasy.otl* moved to *otls/afanasy.hda*.

- Each not numeric task can have an own extra `environment <../afanasy/job_task.html#environment>`_.

v3.2.0
======

2021.04.18

**New Afanasy network protocol version.**

- Such config parameters as
  *af_render_heartbeat_sec*,
  *af_render_up_resources_period*,
  *af_render_zombietime* and
  *af_render_exit_no_task_time*
  moved to pool parameters:
  `heartbeat_sec <../afanasy/pools.html#heartbeat-sec>`_,
  `resources_update_period <../afanasy/pools.html#resources-update-period>`_,
  `zombie_time <../afanasy/pools.html#zombie-time>`_,
  `exit_no_task_time <../afanasy/pools.html#exit-no-task-time>`_.
  On change they will be dispatched to all pool renders.
  This way you can tune farm "on-the-fly". Parameter *af_render_connection_lost_time* removed.
  Now render just uses the same *zombie_time* parameter as server for connection lost.
- Parsers `do <../afanasy/render.html#do>`_ function takes arguments via dictionary.
  I hope that is was the last time we needed to change all parsers classes on a function interface change.
- Parser takes resources string and can return resources string.
  Takes host resources as JSON, that afrender gets for server and GUIs.
  Can return any custom resources, for example peak memory usage or (and) triangles count.
  Server stores this string in statistics database and dispatches to GUIs.
- `RENDER_NO_TASK <../afanasy/server.html#render-no-task>`_ event
  and pool `no_task_event_time <../afanasy/pools.html#no-task-event-time>`_ parameter.
- `RENDER_OVERLOAD <../afanasy/server.html#render-overload>`_ event
  and pool `overload_event_time <../afanasy/pools.html#overload-event-time>`_ parameter.
- AfWatch jobs thumbnails size buttons.
- Server `HTTP configuration <../afanasy/webgui.html#http-server-configuration>`_ added.
  Now it is more easy to make server to serve some custom or even several WebGUIs.

- **Bugfixes**

	- AfWatch Work monitor allows modifications only in admin mode.
	- AfWatch Users and Farm monitors allow selection and current item change only in admin mode.
	- AfWatch Job Block operations fixed to work on MS Windows.
	- AfWatch Job Tasks List window on open task progresses refreshing.
	- AfWatch Jobs List hidden nodes mix on reopen / monitor type or change fixed.

v3.1.1
======

  Useful for UI space economy, especially on jobs with a big blocks count.
  In a View Options menu you can collapse/expand all jobs,
  and set an option to collapse new jobs.
- Houdini submission ROP works with Python 3.
  Now you can choose to download Houdini with internal Python 3.

v3.1.0
======

2020.10.05

**New Afanasy network protocol version.**

- Afanasy pool tickets got maximum hosts property.
  This is mostly needed for licence hosts limits.
  There is a common type of licensing where you can run multiple instances of software on same host, occupying only single license.

v3.0.0
======

2020.09.13

**New Afanasy network protocol version.**

- :ref:`afanasy-pools`
	Now renders are organized in pools hierarchy.
	All farm (services, capacity, limits, ...) settings are configured by pool properties.

	.. warning::

		You will loose your previous farm setup described in **farm.json**.

- :ref:`afanasy-tickets`
	Pools Job blocks got Tickets.
	It is like named capacity.

	You can set root pool NUKE:20 pool tickets to limit Nuke licenses on the entire farm.
	You can set some pool MEM:64 host tickets to limit RAM.
	And set corresponding tickets to your job blocks.

- Render node becomes *Sick*, when it produces errors only from different users.
- ``RENDER_SICK`` and ``RENDER_ZOMBIE`` events.
- AfWatch got side panel to manipulate nodes.
- AfWatch admin mode let you to mark task as DONE w/o SKIP state.

  GUIs show it.
  Useful for a single task blocks, no need to open job to see what host your simulation running on.
- Try this task next.
  You can ask server to solve some task(s) as soon as possible.
  Also you can specify such tasks via Python API on a job submission.
- Each Afanasy node stores running services counts.

v2.3.0
======

2018.10.17

**New Afanasy network protocol version.**

- Afanasy:
	- Generally new class :ref:`afanasy-branch` appeared.
	  Now jobs solving is going within branches hierarchy.
	  Branches can represent departments/projects/assets and you can vary their priorities.
	- Job block/task command and files pattern frame replacement is processed in a Python service class.
	  Later it was coded in libafanasy and processed by afserver, and you could not alter it.
	  Now you can use custom frame patterns.
	  AfRender receives a pattern and frame settings (first, last, increment) instead of a ready command/files.
	  This is much more flexible.
	  For example, now in a Python service class we can check all numeric task files for existence and size.
	  And decide to skip task execution if all files are fine.
	- Task `progress change timeout <../afanasy/job_block.html#task-progress-change-timeout>`__  job block parameter.
	- Task `minimum run time <../afanasy/job_block#task-min-run-time>`__ job block parameter.
	- New user max_run_tasks_per_host and jobs_life_time default values are configurable.
	- Some config parameters renamed:
		- ``af_maxrunningtasks`` -> ``af_max_running_tasks``
		- ``filenamesizemax`` -> ``file_name_size_max``
	- Houdini submission:
		- Job Branch, Wait Time and Task Minimum Run Time parameters added.
- RULES:
	- Each playlist item has an own delete button.
	- Shots export to table *frames_num* column added.
- Bugfixes:
	- Afanasy:
		Server - Python API communication invalid JSON answer fixed:
			- Server JSON answer will never contain extra ``A`` character after JSON object finish (latest ``}``).
			- Python API will never try to read JSON data over message size.
	- Server JSON answer *task_files* fixed, now it escape file names.
	  Later when server was running on windows, ``\`` slashes produced JSON syntax error.
	- Server hung on incoming JSON with invalid syntax fixed.

v2.2.3
======

2017.11.02

- Afanasy:
	- Server creates all needed threads for network IO at start.
	  Networking threads pool size is configurable.
	  Later it has to create a thread for each incoming connection.
	  Now server can handle bigger amount of clients, consumes less system resources for it.
	  Later on some systems afserver could even hung when clients count is more than about a hundred.
	  As system can fail to create 100 threads per second for a long time (have no time to free all thread resources every second).
	- Linux server can be configured to use not-blocking network IO based on Linux EPOLL facility.
	  By default Linux will use the same blocking (threading) IO, as on other platforms.
	  Non-blocking IO consumes less system resources and can handle more connections at the same time.
	- AfWatch (libafqt) switched to non-blocking network IO based on Qt Signal-Slot mechanism.
	  Now it works better (less hangs) with afserver that has a big total amount on clients.
	- Farm setup allows new machines can be configured to register paused/nimby.
	  This can be useful for a just born machines to not to produce error tasks.
	  When a new afrender registers, but has not enough software installed yet.
	- You can find for some string in the text in task output/log in AfWatch.
	- Double click needed on a button to skip and restart task in AfWatch task window.
	  This can help to prevent unwanted task restart by a single occasional click.
	- Previewcmd options added: Houdini *Mplay* and *DJV* open source sequence player.
	- Houdini submission:
		- Shorter names for afanasy temporary .hip files.
		- Camera verification for Mantra submission.
		- Support for *Alembic* submission with progress.
		- Support for *Wedge* submission with block per wedge.
- Bugfixes:
	- Afanasy:
		- After server restart, reconnected tasks are not ignored by "Max Run Tasks Per Host" limit.
		- Multi-host task start and server hung fixed.
		  This bug appeared in 2.2.1.
		- MS Windows server tasks state storing fixed.
		  Later, after restart, it run done tasks again.
		  This bug appeared in 2.2.1.
		- Server memory leak fixed.
		- Houdini Current frame submission fixed.

		- AfServer on some Linux distributions can hung when clients number over 100.
		  Fixed - reduced default (configurable) afserver client thread stack size.
		- Parser Error fixed.
		  Later on Parser Error, afrender can ignore its restart from afserver and task update/stop timeouts happen.

- `Forum <http://forum.cgru.info/>`__.
- Keeper shows machine memory usage in a system tray icon.
- Afanasy:
	- Isotropix :ref:`software-clarisse` support.
	- AfServer solves jobs by running tasks total capacity (by default), not just by running tasks count.
	- Each new job acquires an unique serial number. You can get jobs from server by serial.
	- Linux distributives that has a native Python 3, Qt 5 switched on these new libs version.
	- Qt 4 and Python 2 are still supported. There is no plan to discontinue this support for the near feature.

  Such calculations will be processed on a farm via Afanasy.
- Movie Maker: AV conversion tool is configurable.
  You can set a custom command or executable path.
  The default is *ffmpeg*.
  Some Linux distributions switched from *ffmpeg* to *avconv*. For now, they are fully compatible.
- Afanasy JSON protocol:
	- Jobs list can be generated providing to server an array of user names.
	- Server configuration and farm setup can be reloaded via JSON message.
- Bugfixes:
	- Movie Maker and RULES thumbnails: EXR and DPX colorspace problem is solved.
	  You need at least ImageMagick >= 6.8.8-8 version for it.
	  EXR bug was in CGRU, DPX bug was in ImageMagick.
- Afanasy Web GUI: Sorting and filtering parameters storing.
- Afanasy Server: Several bugs that can cause hang fixed.
  You should definitely switch to this version as soon as possible.
  It is fully compatible with 2.0.0 (you can just replace afserver binary only).

v2.0.0
======

2014.03.01

- No SQL
	Afanasy server stores state in *json* files in its temporary folder.
	Now SQL stands for statistics only.
	If you does not need statistics you can not to setup SQL at all (or setup it later).

	.. warning::

		Server state will not be stored switching to this version.
		You will loose all jobs, renders and users settings if any.

	*So now on MS Windows OS, Afanasy server does not needs any installation/configuration procedures to work.
	Just run (double click) cgru/start/AFANASY/_afserver.cmd.
	Or drag a link to Startup menu for auto launch at logon.*

- Authentication
	Afanasy *json* protocol has an authentication mechanism.
	It uses `Digest Access Authentication <http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Digest_access_authentication>`__ method.
	IP Trust mask allows to skip authentication.
	By default mask allows any IP, and if you did not configured it, you should not notice authentication at all.
	Binary protocol does not have authentication mechanism.
	If IP does not match trust mask and message uses binary protocol (not *json*) - message will be ignored.
	This was designed to use Web GUI not from a local network.
	Note, that it is only authentication mechanism and not data encryption.
	But passwords are not sent in a plain text, and even are not stored in a plain text (see Digest description).

- Python service class got doPost method.
	You can do some post process there.
	If post command requires enough calculation, you can return a list of commands (strings) from this function.
	In this case all that commands will be executed in child subprocesses and output will attached to task output.

- Thumbnails
	If task (block) has files parameter or parser finds images thumbnail will be generated.
	Thumbnails are generated by afrender.
	Python service *doPost* function returns commands for it.
	This commands can be configured.
	Thumbnail files binary data is send by afrender to afserver along with task output.
	Server stores all files that afrender sends on task finish.
	AfWatch and Web GUI can show thumbnails.
	You can get tasks thumbnails from afserver by HTTP GET method.
	Python parser class can find images in task output.
	Python service class can ask parsed images for thumbnails generation.

- Python parser class got mode argument in parse function.
	This argument stands for task subprocess status.
	For example, now parser knows whether the task is running or finished and how it was finished.
	Now if a task has finished with success you can set an error if output does not contain some required result.
- All plugins from *cgru/afanasy/plugins/* moved to *cgru/plugins/*.
	That old plugins location came from SVN age, when Afanasy has branches, tags, trunk. Within Git it is not needed.
	So now there is no mess where to put or find files in *cgru/plugins/* or *cgru/afanasy/plugins*.
- You can add new user via JSON. An example is located in *cgru/examples/json/*.
- WindowsMustDie function configures via general configure system (json files).
  So there is no a special *windowsmustdie.txt* file now.
- Python service class now instance parser class itself.
  So you can exchange information between service and parser classes.
- Python API Block and Task classes *setFiles* method takes an array of string.
  And not a single string where several files are separated with ';'.
  **You should fix your custom submission scripts if any.**
- CGRU Home folder on MS Windows OS moved to *%APPDATA%/cgru/*.
  It is used to keep user personal configuration.
  Previously it was in *%HOMEPATH%/.cgru/* where *%HOMEPATH%* is usually user Documents folder.
- Web GUI is not "beta".
  It is a full functional GUI for Afanasy, that can replace AfWatch (Qt).
- RULES is not "beta".
  But there is still the lack of documentation and lots of things to do.
- There is no *temporary* users.
  Any (each) user in stored in its json file.
  No *af_user_zombietime* variable - time for temporary user to have no jobs to be deleted.
  (Temporary was a user that was not stored in SQL database.)
- Maya
	- No overriding scripts.
	- No auto scripts sourcing.
	- No plugins auto load.
	- No CGRU main menu auto launch.

	Sow now CGRU in Maya is just a set of stand-alone scripts,
	and it does not modify any native Maya interface and workflow.
	This means the lost of some features:

	- No autosave manager.
	- No auto project seek.
	- No Outliner and Channels menus custom items.

	Since Maya 2014 CGRU main menu appears on load *cgru.mll* plugin.
	For auto load, enable it in plugins manager window.
	Or you can source *cgru.mel* from a shelf or *userSetup.mel*.
- Movie Maker
	*ffmpeg* and *convert* binaries are removed from Linux packages.
	There are two reasons for it.
	Modern Linux distributions has various dependences to build and install them,
	so it begin harder and harder to support them in CGRU.
	Also modern Linux distributions already has enough high versions of this products to support EXR and H264.
	If you need to some special version of this binaries, you can to download and build it yourself,
	there is no problems in Linux to compile them manually.

	Debian based packages will have *ffmpeg* and *imagemagick* (*convert*) dependences.
	As all such distributions has them in native repositories (they are usually enough big).

	RPM based packages will not have only *imagemagick* dependency,
	as for *ffmpeg* you need to add some extra repository (native repositories are usually small).
	The exception is AltLinux.

	MS Windows release will continue to contain this executables.

- AfTalk Afanasy chat client was removed from the project.

- Bugfixes:
	- Server hung when a job with no blocks sent.
	- Change job bock (tasks) command (working folder) change from watch GUI.
	- Post command ignore when job json file send with afcmd.
	- Change any user parameter resets jobs solving method to 'order'.

v1.7.0
======

2013.06.05

**New Afanasy network protocol version.**

- WEB GUI (beta).
- RULES (beta).
	It has begun!
- Forum (beta).
  Based on RULES web engine.
- Parser can return running task *activity* string parameter.
  For example Nuke can notify which of stereo views is rendering now.
  Movie Maker notify whether an encoding is started.
  Activity string is shown by GUI in job tasks list window for each task item.
- Render client Nimby can be set to free if computer is idle for some time.
  You can configure it in farm setup.
  Machine considered as idle if CPU busy percentage is less than *idle_cpu* value.
  It is useful for render on workstations that artists left.
- Render client Nimby can be turned on if computer CPU is busy for some time and has no Afanasy task.
  You can configure it in farm setup.
  Machine considered as busy if CPU busy percentage greater than *busy_cpu* value.
- Afanasy server sends to GUI tasks percentage with renders list.
  GUI renders list items show running tasks percentage.
- New system job block - **events**.
  New service - **events**.
  Afanasy server can generate events, on job error, for example.
  Events are pushed to system job as tasks for events block.
  Render farm can process events, send email notifications for example.
- Each afnode has a custom data.
  Afanasy server sends this data to render to service class with a task.
  In Python service class you can do with this data what you want.
  For example user email parameter and events settings are stored in custom data via JSON.
- You can restart all job running tasks from GUI menuitem.
- Archived binaries Python version is 3.3.2.
- Bugfixes:
	- AfWatch: Several blocks selection for some action works.

v1.6.12
=======

2013.03.22

- Afanasy configuration now has parameters to control user ability to change priority:
  *af_perm_user_mod_his_priority* and *af_perm_user_mod_job_priority*.
  By default user can change his own priority and his jobs priority.
  Set this parameters to *false<* and only admin will be allowed to change priorities.
- Movie Maker: Apple ProRes codec presets.
- Tested with Nuke 7 - works fine.
- Bugfixes:
	- Movie Maker: H264 (ffmpeg-libx264) uses 420 pixel format instead of 444 to work on most players.
	- Nuke Submission: Fixed to render Write-nodes inside group.
	- Nuke Render Script: Fixed to render different views in different folders.

v1.6.11
=======

2013.02.15

- Maya users should look at  `meTools for Afanasy <http://meshstudio.blogspot.ru/2013/01/metools-for-afanasy.html>`__. And use it.
- Nuke and Paths Map: Filename filter can be added to always have valid paths on any OS in the same script.
  You can configure to add or not to add it - not to break you potential in-house filters.
- Tested on Windows 8 - works fine.
- Bugfixes:
	- Nuke Submission: Negative frame range fixed.
	- Nuke Render Script: Fixed to render several views in one file (you can write stereo in a singe EXR).
	- AfStarter Blender: Now does not ignore output images parameter.
	- Paths Map: Now works with big files thousands times faster.
	- AfServer: Enable/Disable service fixed (was broken in last versions while json protocol switch).

======

2012.12.10

- Automatic Wake-On-LAN.
- Bugfixes:
	- Nuke: It does not really use render script when it should not (when there is no paths map or temporary images).

v1.6.7
======

2012.12.03

- All CGRU config files moved to JSON.
  It refers to any Afanasy configuration, farm setup, paths map.
  XML is removed from the project at all.
  Any XML config file will not works.
  AfWatch GUI turning will be reset.

  .. important::

  	You should reconfigure Afanasy.

- Afanasy user 'home' configuration files moved to *HOME/.cgru* from *HOME/.afanasy*.
- One config file can include another file(s).
  Specify a files to be included in "include" string array.
  All include files will be included after all file will be read (not like include directive in most common program languages).
  This is done to override file contents.
  Any next occurrence of a variable with the same name will override previous value.
- Config file can have OS specific section.
  So you can setup different OS-es configs in the same file.
- Paths map setup moved to common config files.
  And you can setup paths map for all OS-es in the same file.
- Some general config parameters, as time format, maximum file name length, command shell, preview commands,
  moved from Afanasy specific config to global CGRU config.
  As they can be used later by other CGRU tools.
- Afanasy on start-up reads CGRU config file and does not tries to find some specific config itself.
  CGRU config file simple includes Afanasy specific config file.
  All Afanasy specific parameters has *af_* prefix now.

v1.6.6
======

2012.09.26

- All Python applications with GUI in CGRU can use and PySide and PyQt.
  At first PySide will be tried to import and than PyQt.
  It means that if you have PySide installed it will be used.
  PySide has LGPL license, PyQt - only GPL.
  So now <b>all components in CGRU has LGPL license</b> or similar.
- New Linux package *afanasy-qtgui* appeared.
  Needed only to remove *libqt* dependence from *afanasy-render* and *afanasy-server* packages
  (to not to install huge Qt on render nodes).
- Bugfixes:
	- ``afcmd uadd`` works fine (is was broken in v1.6.5 - it added users that can't run any tasks)

v1.6.5
======

2012.09.04

- Movie Maker can fake dailies date and time.
- Python Parser class can consider that task is already done and ask render to stop a task.
  AfRender sends to server that it was finished with a success.
- Bugfixes:
	- Movie Maker open/save parameters and non ASCII characters bug fixed, all operations uses UTF-8 encoding.
	- AfStarter and negative frame values (actually the bug was in afjob.py).
	- Negative frame values and numeric commands with padding (afserver generates commands, so it should be restarted).

v1.6.4
======

2012.06.26

- CGRU now has a domain https://cgru.info.
  Soon documentation from sourceforge.net will be removed.
  If you have RSS subscribed, you should resubscribe on http://cgru.info/doc/cgru_rss_feed.xml
- Bugfixes:
	- Python API *af.Block.setHostsMask* and *af.Block.setHostsMaskExclude*
	  methods are back after occasional deletion when switching to JSON.
	- AfStarter maya_mental submission set verbose level for task progress parsing, afjob.py changed for it.
	- AfStarter dialog GUI dialog bug fixed: *first_frame* <= *last_frame check* works correctly.
	- Nuke CGRU menu open/save scene through paths map fixed.


v1.6.3
======

2012.05.07

- Nuke render and submission scripts options added to skip paths map and render to temporary image stages.
  Render hosts (farm) should be updated too to recognize such options, as not only submission script changed.
- Bugfixes:
	- Nuke render just one frame fixed.
	- Depend sub task and depended block frames per task > 1 fixed.

v1.6.2
======

2012.04.23

- API is based on JSON now.
	Python API is the same but no binary module needed, it communicates with server itself by JSON build-in module.
	(All Python API is written on Python language, not on Python C API.)
	You can communicate with Afanasy server within any language/script that can create JSON structures.
	(No libafanasy needed to send and get data, all possible linking problems are in the past.)

	JSON protocol is not finished. Finished only job structure - to remove python binary module dependence to send a job.

- Bugfixes:
	- AfWatch shows tasks with no service icon.
	- AfWatch filtering and sorting nodes when new nodes created and old changed fixed.
	- Houdini render script loads scene within try-catch to pass warning exception.
	- Nuke dailies node can handle tcl expressions, it uses *getEvaluatedValue()* instead of *value()*.
	- Nuke render script changes *root.project_directory* according to OS paths map (for mixed OS-es farm rendering).

v1.6.1
======

2012.03.28

- Tasks can be solved in a not-sequential manner.

  For example 1-10: 0 9 5 2 7 1 3 6 8 4

  This can be needed to catch some error earlier and to calculate average running time more accurate.
- You can hide jobs or renders in AfWatch by some parameter.
  Also you can show only hidden nodes.
  And a new "hidden" parameter was added to every node (job, render) just to hide (and store hidden state).
- Bugfixes:
	- AfWatch can preview tasks of a not-numeric blocks in a task information window (by double click).
	  This is a main reason of this release.

v1.6.0
======

2012.03.22

**New Afanasy network protocol version.**

- New parameter added to configuration *cmd_shell*.
  Render will launch tasks commands with it. Default values are:
  - UNIX: ``/bin/bash -c``
  - MS Windows: ``cmd.exe /c``
- Administrator (super users) can change job owner.
  It can be performed by AfWatch GUI and afcmd CLI.
- You can enable/disable render service via afcmd (CLI).
- AfWatch GUI styles available.
  You can change, copy, modify them, create your own.
  You can set sounds to playback on some events (Job added, finished or got an error).
- Renders list has an ability to change items size.
- No Qt library in Afanasy render client.
  So Qt is used for GUI only now.
- *Magic Number* to filter connections.
- Afanasy server is available for MS Windows OS.
- GitHub https://github.com/cgru CGRU project started.
- Afanasy branches removed from repository.
  Use git for branching.
  As there is no need in branches in project subdirectories structure.

	- Server bug fixed.
	  It could hung on job submission.
	  It was a very rare deadlock bug.
	  I never managed to catch it for 4 years.
	- Keeper hung on new network protocol version fixed.

v1.5.5
======

2012.02.12

- Cinema 4D support.
- Maya Bins release removed.
  Use archive for MS Windows for or Linux to get plugins for Maya.

- Movie Maker can save and load settings, keeps recent jobs options.
- Nuke submit and render scripts can handle write node file expressions.
- Python Class Block - added following functions: setErrorsAvoidHost, setErrorsForgiveTime, setErrorsRetries, setErrorsTaskSameHost.
- Afanasy stand-alone starter has an ability to add some custom arguments to command.
- Server has an acceptable IP Addresses Mask.
  Connections form addresses not matching specified masks will be ignored by server.
- User can set jobs solving method to parallel.
- Afanasy now supports only PostgreSQL database engine.
  QtSql library replaced with native PostgreSQL libpq in libafsql module.
  So there is no Qt in afserver and afcmd applications (as later Qt was removed from libafanasy).
  Do not forget to update you server database connection settings, if you override defaults.
- Bugfixes:
	- Afanasy Starter error message in console fixed, sending a job and with Python 2.x
	  (Fedora Linux raises a warning in system tray in this case).
- Paths map works in lower case mode on windows and only in client -> server direction
  So you can use paths with uppercase letters with UNIX clients and MS Windows.

v1.5.4
======

2011.12.22

- `AltLinux <http://www.altlinux.ru>`__ RPM packages support.
- "Nimby" schedule improved.
  Now if *time begin* > *time end* it assumes that *time end* is tomorrow.
  So now you can set for example for Monday that *time begin* is 14:00 and *time end* is 1:00, and it makes render free at Tuesday 1:00.
- Afanasy stand-alone starter has an ability customize command, preview images and OS needed for render.
- Blender Cycles render engine support.

- Keeper tray icon displays Afanasy local render client status.
- Bugfixes:
	- Keeper AFANASY client operation local host name bug fixed.
	  Bug was, for example, if you are setting NIMBY on "c1" machine,
	  it will be set to all computers with name starts with "c1": "c10","c11","c19" ... 
- Movie Maker fixed to work with a sequence without padding specified ("%d" or single "#" character).
- Houdini submission fixed. Afanasy ROP got a check for a null connection.
  Full path to ROP is used. You can to submit ROPs placed anywhere in a scene, not only from "/out/".

v1.5.1
======

2011.11.14

- **Keeper** - CGRU applications managing program.
- **Afanasy Starter** - Standalone dialog to submit jobs to Afanasy.
- **Adobe After Effects** support.

	- Nuke submission frame increment parameter not ignored any more.

v1.5.0
======

2011.08.29

**New Afanasy network protocol version.**

- Houdini submission improvements.
  You can connect several Afanasy and other ROP nodes together to describe a complex job with dependencies between ROPs.
- Block tasks can depend on other block sub-task progress.
- New job parameter *Maximum running tasks per host*.
  The same parameter was added to job block.
- You can override render *Max Tasks* parameter directly from Watch in super user mode.
- New numeric pattern replacement rules.

	.. important::

		You should delete all jobs on server as their tasks commands can be invalid.

		Jobs created by your custom submission scripts probably will generate invalid numeric tasks too.
		But it is very simple to fix them.

		You should to fix your custom submission scripts.

- Server stores renders IP and MAC addresses in a database.
  So you can perform some operations with off-line renders after server restart (for example wake-on-lan).
- On start, server checks all database tables, and adds (removes) needed columns.
- All date/time and frame range parameters are 64bit integers.
- All numeric types has BIGINT SQL type.
- Numeric tasks block "frame increment" (or "by frame") parameter plays role in tasks generation.
  It means that blocks with this parameter grater then one will have less tasks number.

  .. important::

  		You should delete all jobs on server before upgrade to this version.

- Bugfixes:
	- Web Visor statistics average farm usage parameter does not ignore custom dates range.

	  No library needed, it is implemented by headers only.
	- Regular expressions moved from Qt to `POSIX <http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Regular_expression>`__,
	  they are almost the same. No library needed. They are in C standard, already realized in GCC and MSVC>=2008SP1.
	- No Qt needed for *libafanasy* and so for *libafapi* and *libpyaf* too.
	  No errors can happen importing Python module in other software using Qt.
	- Windows version moved to static Qt libraries. No errors can happen with various Qt "dll"s in PATH.
	- If parsing is no needed, parser should have an empty string name.
	  Render do not tries to import parser module with an empty name, no error happen.
- Bugfixes:
	- Nuke render script: A try to delete moved temporary image removed.
	- Listen job and task output connection error fixed.
	- Numeric command frame(s) replacement bug fixed.

  and for <a href="../afanasy/doc/user.html#ErrorsForgiveTime">user</a>.
  It is a time form last host error to exclude it from error hosts list.
- System job
	Now job (and block) post commands are executed on a render farm by a special system job.
	**Your farm hosts must have "system" service to execute job post commands (remove rendered scenes).**

	- Nuke afanasy gizmo: If it creates output folder, it creates recursive all needed folders.
	- Watch job tasks list: Block item error hosts counters corrected.
	- Server stores job order in user list in database, so on server restart user jobs list order restored.
	- When parser on render finds an error, and than rapidly finds a warning, error status may be lost.

v1.2.0
======

2010.08.02

**New Afanasy network protocol version. New Afanasy database schema.**


- Afanasy Python *Custom Resources Meter*.
  You can measure any resource by writing you Python resource meter class.
- Afanasy Python Parsers has a new functionality.
  A parser can produce *warning* to notify user, *error* to stop task with error,
  *bad result* to finish task like with bad exit status (with error in any way).
- Afanasy render client *Windows Must Die* function.
  It finds and kills windows with specified names.
  When process crashes, MS Windows can raise a window with apologizes.
  This can hang process until someone closes the window.
  (AfRender periodically sends WM_CLOSE signal to windows listed in special file.)
- Houdini Separate Render
  ROP to separate Mantra ROP render process on 'ifd' files generation and 'mantra' command render.
  It can also split one frame into tiles and render them simultaneous,
  clean 'ifd' files, clean tiles and render an image in local temporary folder,
  and after successful render copy it to network location
  (it can save network traffic, as host do not often write small portions of an image during calculations).
- Block *Frames Per Task* parameter can be negative.
  Needed for sub-frame dependency.
- Afanasy has an ability to map paths.
  You can setup farm with various platforms clients.

- Movie Maker works on MS Windows.
  Linux releases has *ffmpeg* binary compiled with *x264* library to encode 'H.264' codec.
  Windows users need to install `ImageMagick <http://www.imagemagick.org>`__, which contains 'ffmpeg' with 'x264'.
- SoftImage XSI submit to Afanasy scripts.
  XSI Afanasy service and parser.
- Lots of bug-fixes for MS Windows platform. Windows version can be called 'beta'.
